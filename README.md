# Gist Aggregator
Gist Aggregator is a small project to learn about AJAX, HTML, and Javascript by creating a webpage that aggregates "gists" 
from Github. Gists are queried from the Github public API which returns a paginated response that is then reflected on a sample
web page.

To run the project, simply open ```gists.html``` in a web browser.
